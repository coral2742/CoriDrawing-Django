*   The list of outdated packages was generated by `pip list --outdated --format=json`.
*   Vulnerability checks were performed using the GitHub Advisory Database (`https://github.com/advisories`).
*   Only a subset of outdated packages (`cryptography`, `PyJWT`, `tornado`) were checked for vulnerabilities due to time constraints. Other outdated packages may also have vulnerabilities.
*   It is always recommended to update packages to their latest non-vulnerable versions.
