General Note:
*   This list is based on searches in the GitHub Advisory Database.
*   "Not vulnerable" means no specific advisories were found for the given version during the search. It's always good practice to keep packages updated to their latest stable non-vulnerable releases.
*   For packages not found to be vulnerable, the recommendation is to keep them at their current version unless a newer version is required for compatibility or other features.
